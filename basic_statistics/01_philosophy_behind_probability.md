## Two conceptions of probability
1. Degree of belief
	- More subjective probability
	- Can be seen in Bayesian statistics with priors representing an insertion of some degree of belief
2. Chance
	- More objective validation
	- Represents the relative frequencies, or numbers that tell us how often things happen
