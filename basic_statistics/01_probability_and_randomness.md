## Chance
- Two conceptions of probability
	1. Degree of belief
		- More subjective probability
		- Can be seen in Bayesian statistics with priors representing an insertion of some degree of belief
	2. Chance
		- More objective validation
		- Represents the relative frequencies, or numbers that tell us how often things happen

## Randomness and Determinism
- If we assume that we are living in a deterministic world (everything that happens is predetermined and given the same exact situation, the same exact things will happen), then there is no "random" process or experiment at all
- In this case, "randomness" is merely used to represent what might happen given our limited knowledge. If we had perfect knowledge of a system, nothing would be random
- For example, a coin toss may not be considered to be random if we knew the coin's initial orientation, the impact point between my finger and the coin, the turbulence in the air, the surface smoothness of the table the coin lands on, the material characteristics of the coin and the table, and so on.
	- We would be able to definitively say whether the coin would come up heads or tails. 

## Bias
- A random sample should be irregular with respect to the population variables of interest, but should eventually converge
- If variables from the random sample do not have similar dependencies as the variables from the population of interest, then there may be some level of systematic error or bias that has been introduced to the experiment
	- Meaning, the sample shouldn't have any absence or presence of other dependencies with respect to the population variables of interest with a large enough sample size
	- In other words, if there are any dependencies between variables for the population, there should be similar dependencies between those same variables for any sample with a large sample size
