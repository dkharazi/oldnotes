## Stochasticity
- A stochastic process is a sequence of random variables
	- It’s common to write the successive random variables S0, S1, ...St, ...Sn, which all belong to the same function. Therefore, the space each of these random variables lives over is the same, and when we need to talk about that space, then we’ll talk about S, and realizations will be s

## Determinism
- Determinism is a property of a process (i.e. function, system, experiment, etc.)
	- Processes are either deterministic or stochastic
- If we insert the same inputs into a function, then we will receive the same outputs no less than 100% of the time
	- Everything that happens is predetermined

## Randomness and its Relationship to Determinism
- If we assume that we are living in a deterministic world, then there is no "random" variable or stochastic process at all
- In this case, "randomness" is merely used to represent what might happen given our limited knowledge
- If we had perfect knowledge of a system, nothing would be random
- For example, a coin toss may not be considered to be random if we knew the coin's initial orientation, the impact point between my finger and the coin, the turbulence in the air, the surface smoothness of the table the coin lands on, the material characteristics of the coin and the table, and so on.
        - We would be able to definitively say whether the coin would come up heads or tails.

## The Relationship of Stochasticity and Randomness
- Stochasticity and randomness are roughly synonymous in meaning
- The main difference between the two notions seems to be stricly contextual
- We typically describe variables as random and a process as stochastic
	- However, we still hear people say "random process" and "stochastic variable"
		- Example: random sampling is actually a stochastic function that requires the use of random variables as inputs
	- This is because they only really differ in context and not meaning
- A stochastic process can be defined as a function that maps random variables to their observed outputs
