## Stochasticity
- A stochastic process is a sequence of random variables
- A stochastic process is indexed by some other variable (typically indexed by time)
- We can define a stochastic process as S, which can also be thought of as a sequence of successive random variables S0, S1, ...St, ...Sn, which all belong to the same function 
	- In other words, the space each of these random variables lives over is the same, and when we need to talk about that space, then weâ€™ll talk about S, and realizations will be written as s

## Determinism
- Determinism is a property of a process (i.e. function, system, experiment, etc.)
	- Processes are either deterministic or stochastic
- If we insert the same inputs into a function, then we will receive the same outputs no less than 100% of the time
	- In other words, the random variables X and Y are deterministic of each other if every occurrence of X can be predetermined if we're given an occurence of Y, and vice versa

## Randomness and its Relationship to Independence
- Independence refers to a lack of any pattern associated with a given set of random variables
	- Independence is a property of the relationship between a set of random variables
- Randomness refers to a lack of determinism involved between a set of random variables (i.e. a process)
	- Randomness is more of a property of the data sampling process

## Randomness and its Relationship to Determinism
- If we assume that we are living in a deterministic world, then there is no "random" variable or stochastic process at all
- In this case, "randomness" is merely used to represent what might happen given our limited knowledge
- If we had perfect knowledge of a system, nothing would be random
- For example, a coin toss may not be considered to be random if we knew the coin's initial orientation, the impact point between my finger and the coin, the turbulence in the air, the surface smoothness of the table the coin lands on, the material characteristics of the coin and the table, and so on.
        - We would be able to definitively say whether the coin would come up heads or tails.

## The Relationship of Stochasticity and Randomness
- Stochasticity and randomness are roughly synonymous in meaning
- The main difference between the two notions seems to be stricly contextual
	- We typically describe variables as random and a process as stochastic
- A stochastic process can be sometimes thought of as a function that maps random variables to their observed outputs
