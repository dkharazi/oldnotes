## The Law of Large Numbers
- Assuming X1, X2 ...Xn are independent, identically-distributed (IID) random variables. X has the finite mean µ. The average of the first n of them is Sn ≡ (1/n)∑Xi
- The means of IID sequences converge to the mean of the variables: Sn −−−−→ µ as n −→ ∞

## The Central Limit Theorem
- Assuming that X has a finite variance σ2, then as n → ∞, the Sn random variables converge to a Gaussian random variable with mean µ and variance σ2
- The Central Limit Theorem will fail if the realizations associated with X:
	1. Are not independent
	2. Are not identically distributed
	3. Do not have constant variances

## Why Things are Gaussian?
- Whenever we have additive effects of many independent causes, each of which has only a small relative effect, we are inclined to
suspect Gaussians
- In other words, when you combine many independent random variables, the result tends towards a Gaussian (normal) distribution, since the errors in measurements, or of those random variables, are normally distributed
	-  Thus the many biological examples of Gaussian distributions
		- E.g. chest widths of Scots army recruits
		- E.g. annual number of sucides in Belgium
