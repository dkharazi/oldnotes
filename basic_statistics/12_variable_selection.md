## General Description
- Using p-values for variable selection, or to find the most "significant" variables, is typically a bad idea
	- because p-values are influenced by many other facotrs, such as sample size
- Sometimes, we confuse variable selection with determining how well the model will predict new data
- Therefore, we typically want to use cross-validation and calculate mallow's cp statistic or AIC to measure how well the model will predict new data
