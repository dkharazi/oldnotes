## General Description
- Correlation is defined as the association (or dependence) between two variables (typically referring to a linear relationship)
- Causation is defined as the cause of one variable results in an effect in the other variable
- Correlation is not causation
- Not even statistical dependence is causation
- At best, both of these statements tell us that there's an association between two variable, but not necessarily causation

## Examples of Correlation but not Causation
- Confounding variables
	- A third variable causes our response and predictor variable
	- For example, ice cream sales and homicide rates are correlated, but the relationship is not causal (i.e. ice cream sales and homicides are most likely caused by weather)

## Testing Correlation and Causation
- Determining correlation between two variable involves simpler statistical testing, such as hypothesis testing
- Determining causation between two variables involves complicated statistical testing in a completely controlled environment using AB testing
