## The Essence of Dynamical Systems
- A dynamical system is a system in which a function describes the time dependence of a point in a geometrical space
- Said another way, a dynamical system is a collection of random variables that is indexed by time
- A stochastic dynamical system is a dynamic system subjected to the effects of noise
	- In other words, a dynamic system is considered to be stochastic if the system requires mapping its inputs to outputs using probabilities
- A deterministic dynamical system is a dynamic system that isn't subjected to the effect of noise
- We will be interested in stochastic dynamical systems in the majority of our research

## Systems and States
- In our case, a system refers to a collection of states indexed by time, which represents some broader notion
	- Examples: The stock market, weather, etc.
- A state refers to a distinct observation of some random variable
	- Examples: Stock market goes up, the weather being sunny, etc.

## Difference between State Space and Sample Space
- State Spaces are used in Dynamics
	- State spaces imply that there is a time progression and that our system will assume different states as time progresses
	- Example of a state space of the largest number up to nth roll is a number from the state space {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- Sample Spaces are used more often in Statistics
	- A sample space represents a set of distinct observations of some random variable
	- There is typically a probability distribution associated with each state
	- Example of a sample space for a single die roll: Î© = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- In summary:
	- We typically expect to be thinking about probabilities when we hear "sample spaces", unlike "state spaces", which do not carry that connotation
	- State spaces are typically indexed by time, unlike sample spaces, which do not carry that connotation
