## Stochasticity
- A stochastic process is a sequence of random variables
- A stochastic process is indexed by some other variable (typically indexed by time)
- We can define a stochastic process as S, which can also be thought of as a sequence of successive random variables S0, S1, ...St, ...Sn, which all belong to the same function
- In other words, the space each of these random variables lives over is the same, and when we need to talk about that space, then weâ€™ll talk about S, and any realizations of S will be written as s

## Difference between Stochasticity and Determinism
- Determinism is any process that isn't stochastic, or doesn't involve an element of randomness
- In a stochastic process, we are interested in a "best guess"
- In a deterministic process, we are interested in a "consistent solution"
- A deterministic process can be determined by an exact formula, whereas a stochastic process can't be determined by an exact formula and involves "guessing"

## Examples of Deterministic Processes
- Gravity (F=ma)
	- We only need to know an object's mass and acceleration in order to determine the force of an object
- Kelvin (K=C+273.15)
	- We only need to know the degrees in Celsius in order to determine the degrees in Kelvin

## Examples of Stochastic Processes
- Rolling a die
- Flipping a coin
- Rolling a die based on last flip
	- This is an example of a Markovian Chain, which has the same probability space as rolling a die (without knowing the last toss)
- Flipping a coin (based on last flip)
	-- This is an example of a Markovian Chain, which has the same probability space as flipping a coin (without knowing the last flip)
