## Overview
- Markov Chain implies that we include an independent variable in our model that represents some current observation, and a dependent variable in our model that represents the previous observation
	- Example: Independent variable is receiving a Heads, and the dependent variable is receiving a Tails (we would expect the P(H|T)=0.5, P(H|H)=0.5, P(T|H)=0.5, and P(T|T)=0.5 in the long run)
