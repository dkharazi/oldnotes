## Sampling
- A sampling distribution is a distribution represented by our data
- Our hope is that the sampling distribution successfully reflects out population distribution of interest

## Description of Monte Carlo Sampling
- Monte Carlo refers to the most basic form of sampling, and the form of sampling we are all mostly likely familiar with
- Most algorithms involving sampling, or even other sampling procedures, include some form of Monte Carlo sampling
	- i.e. Gibb's Sampling
	- i.e. MCMC
- Monte Carlo Sampling is an application of the Law of Large Numbers
	- In other words, the Law of Large Numbers is a thoery/concept, whereas Monte Carlo Sampling is an application of that theory

## Assumptions of Monte Carlo Sampling
- Assumes that we have a proper sampling procedure
	- i.e. simple random sampling
- Assumes that we know the population distribution
- Assumes that we have a good source of random variables

## Definition of Monte Carlo Sampling
- Monte Carlo Simulation is a sampling procedure that involves gathering many observations from a population
- The goal of Monte Carlo is to build a sampling distribution that effectively reflects its population distribution
- The Law of Large Numbers makes Monte Carlo Simulation possible
        - As our sample grows larger, our sampling distribution will resemble our population distribution
