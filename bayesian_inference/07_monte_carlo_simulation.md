## Sampling
- We always want to know some property related to our population
	- Maybe the distribution of our population
	- Maybe the expected value of our population
	- Maybe the variance of our population
	- Maybe the probability of observing a certain value in our population
- Unfortunately, our population is infinitely large and/or unknown most of the time
- To solve this problem, we estimate our population
- Estimation is the process of using sampling to calculate guesses of population properties
- Sampling is the process of collecting observations
- A sampling distribution is a distribution represented by our data
- The goal of sampling is to collect data that will give us the best guess of some population property of interest
- In order to find the best guess, we need to collect data that most-closely represents our population

## Motivating the Monte Carlo Method
- If we want to calculate the probability of an observation, then we typically compute integrals by finding antiderivatives of a closed form density function
- Density functions are deterministic functions
	- Specifically, we will always receive the same probability after inputting our parameters and observtion, since the parameters are assumed to be fixed
- Although we like to think that probabilities are generated by a single deterministic function in principle, it is sometimes more accurate to think that probabilties are generated from a probabilistic function
- For example, our deterministic probability function may not use the most accurate fixed parameters (i.e. mean and variance), which leads to inaccurate probability estimates
	- This can especially happen when our sample size is small
	- In this case, our parameter estimates will most likely always lead to poor probability estimates, since our methods for parameter estimation are deterministic (i.e. MLE)
	- Since an element of randomness is included in probabilistic methods of parameter estimation, our parameter estimates have a higher chance of being more accurate compared to using deterministic methods
- The Monte Carlo method is one of the most popular probabilistic methods of estimation

## Definition of Monte Carlo
- Monte Carlo methods generally follow a particular pattern:
	1. Define a domain of possible observations
		- e.g. Let's say we define the random variable X, which can take on the values 1,2,3,4,5,6
	2. Randomly generate simulated values from an assumed probability distribution over the domain
		- Typically, we decide to simulate from a uniform distribution (sometimes we simulate from normal, beta, bernoulli, and poisson distributions)
		- e.g. The more values we simulate, the greater the coverage of our sample space and the more accurate our estimates become
	3. Perform a deterministic computation on the simulated values
		- e.g. We calculate the probability of observing and even number by calculating the percentage of simulated values that are even to the total number of simulated values
	4. Aggregate the results
		- e.g. Construct a probability distribution by calculating the probabilities of observing each observation in the sample space
		- e.g. Create a confidence interval

## Description of Monte Carlo
- Since Monte Carlo simulation is a probablistic method of calculating probabilities, we don't need to worry about estimating parameters involved in a deterministic density function
	- In other words, the Monte Carlo method is a "parameterless" way of calculating probabilities
- The Strong Law of Large Numbers is at the core of the Monte Carlo method
- Essentially, the Monte Carlo method is an application of the Law of Large Numbers
- The Monte Carlo method is also referred to as Monte Carlo simulation
- Simulation essentially refers to artificially generating samples (from some assumed population distribution)
- The Monte Carlo method does not typically involve a random walk algorithm; the random walk algorithm is typically involved in a markov chain instead

## Assumptions of Monte Carlo Sampling
- Assumes that we have a proper sampling procedure
	- i.e. simple random sampling
- Assumes that we know the population distribution
	- i.e. we have a good idea that the population distribution follows a normal distribution, for example
- Assumes that we have a good source of random variables
	- i.e. the sample data (or random variables) closely follows the population distribution

## Definition of Monte Carlo Sampling
- Monte Carlo Simulation is a sampling procedure that involves gathering many observations from a population
- The goal of Monte Carlo is to build a sampling distribution that effectively reflects its population distribution
- The Law of Large Numbers makes Monte Carlo Simulation possible
        - As our sample grows larger, our sampling distribution will resemble our population distribution
