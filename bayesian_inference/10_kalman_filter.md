## General Description
- The Kalman Filter is an iterative mathematical process
- The Kalman Filter uses a set of equations and consecutive data inputs to quickly estimate the true value of the data being measured
- The Kalman Filter is good for estimating the true value of some data when there is a small sample size, since the Kalman Filter tries
