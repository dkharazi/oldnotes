## General Description
- A yield curve is a line that plots yields (i.e. interest rates) of bonds (with equal credit quality) by maturiy dates
- Maturity dates refer to the date on which the principal amount of some debt becomes due
- Upward sloping yield curves occur when shorter-term interest rates are lower than longer-term interest rates
- Upward sloping yield curves indicate economic expansion
- In other words, when the yield curve is upward sloping, the U.S. Treasury is expecting the economy to perform well in the long term future (compared to now)
- Downward sloping yield curves occur when short-term interest rates are greater than longer-term interest rates
- Downward sloping yield curves indicate economic recession
- In other words, when the yield curve is downward sloping, the U.S. Treasury is expecting the economy to not perform well in the long term future (compared to now)
- For example, if lending the government money for 10 years gives me a 1.5% interest rate and lending the government money for 2 years gives me a 1.8% interest rate, then the yield curve is inverted
