## General Description
- The builder pattern is a Gang of Four design pattern
- The builder pattern is a creational design pattern
	- Creational design patterns deal with object creation
- The goal of the builder pattern is to separate object construction from its representation
- In other words, the goal of the builder pattern is to provide the functionality of including optional parameters when creating objects
- The builder design pattern achieves this by calling methods in a step-by-step pattern until the final object is created
