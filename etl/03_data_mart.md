## General Description
- A data mart is a subsection of a data warehouse, designed and built specifically for a particular department or business function

## Types of Data Marts
1. Dependent Data Marts
	- A dependent data mart is constructed from an existing data warehouse
2. Independent Data Marts
	- An independent data mart is created without the use of a data warehouse and focuses on one business function
3. Hybrid Data Marts
	- A hybrid data mart integrates data from an already existing data warehouse and additional operational source systems

## Benefits of Data Marts
- A data mart provides isolated security by only containing data specific to a given department
	- Therefore, we are assured that there isn't any intended data access (i.e. finance data, revenue data)
- A data mart provides isolated performance by only managing performance loads across different departments

## Differences between Data Warehouses and Data Marts
- A data warehouse is a system used for independent yet broader applications, whereas a data mart is a system used for more specific decision-making
- The data in a data warehouse is stored in a centralised archive, whereas a data mart is stored decentrally in multiple different archives
- A data warehouse consists of a detailed form of data, whereas a data mart consists of a summarized and selected data
- The development of a data warehouse involves a top-down approach, while a data mart involves a bottom-up approach
- A data warehouse is thought of as more adjustable, information-oriented and longtime existing; whereas a data mart is thought of as restricted, project-oriented, and has a shorter existence
