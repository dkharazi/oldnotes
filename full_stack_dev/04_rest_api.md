## General Description
- REST is an API architectural style that provides easier evolution on the server side
- A RESTful API is a form of a web service (or web api)
- In other words, all RESTful APIs are web services, but not all web services are RESTful APIs
- REST achieves this by returning data directly related to the client's request and hypermedia links for any other related data
- APIs are RESTful if they satisfy the following:
        - Resources are unambiguously requested via URIs
        - HATEOUS (Hypermedia as the engine of application state): Transitions and actions should be clearly exposed to the client by the server via hyperlinks and hypertext.
