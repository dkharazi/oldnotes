## General Description
- Maximum likelihood estimation is a method of estimating the parameters of a distribution by maximizing its likelihood function
- The output parameters are called the maximum likelihood estimates
- MLE can be seen as a special case of the MAP estimation, where we assume the parameters have a prior that is uniformly distributed

## Algorithm Description
- Technically speaking, maximum likelihood estimation is a method of estimating the parameters of a distribution by finding the parameter values that maximize the likelihood of observing the data given our parameters
- Said another way, maximum likelihood estimation involves finding the value of the parameter that gives us the mode of our sample data
- Said another way, our maximum likelihood estimate is the parameter that gives us the mode
