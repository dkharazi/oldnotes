## General Description
- Polynomial regression is a regression method where the relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y is modelled as an nth degree polynomial in x
- Polynomial regression is used when there is a non-linear relationship between the response variable and a predictor variable
- As we use lower degrees of polynomials, we donâ€™t observe high oscillations of the curve around the data
- In other words, a quadratic function will have one "hump," a cubic function will have two "humps," etc.
- Polynomial regression models are usually fit using the method of least squares

## Mathematics behind Polynomial Regression
- Polynomial regression fits a nonlinear relationship between the value of x and the corresponding conditional mean of y, denoted E(Y|X)
- Although polynomial regression fits a nonlinear model to the data, as a statistical estimation problem it is linear, in the sense that the regression function E(Y|X) is linear in the unknown parameters that are estimated from the data
- For this reason, polynomial regression is considered to be a special case of multiple linear regression
