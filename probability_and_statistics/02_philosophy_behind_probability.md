## Two conceptions of probability
1. Degree of belief
	- Refers to Bayesian statistics
	- The data is all we have to go off of, and should be considered fixed (if anything should be considered the truth)
	- The population parameters are constantly changing and should be represented with some degree of uncertainty
	- There is no concept of a pre-determined "true" value for some population parameter
	- Since we think of probability as something that is constantly being updated and that there is no "true" value, we can insert our own degree of belief (i.e. priors) into any parameters that we see fit
2. Chance
	- Refers to Frequentist statistics
	- The data is only a sample of some larger populations, and therefore is constantly changing and should be represented with some degree of uncertainty
	- The population parameters are fixed and are considered to be some pre-determined "true" values
	- Since we think of probability as something that has already been pre-determined before our samples and represented as long-run frequencies, we believe there is some fixed single value by which are population parameters can be represented
