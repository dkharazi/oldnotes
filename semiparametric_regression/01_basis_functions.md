## Basics of Basis Functions
- Basis functions are thought of as families of transformations of our predictors
- The family function is usually flexible enough to transform our data to a wide variety of shapes, but not overly flexible where there is overfitting
- Roughly speaking, a basis function refers to any function applied to a predictor in a model

## Examples of Basis Functions
- Linear functions
	- Linear functions are the product of any number of constants and a single predictor variable
	- For example: 1*X, -1*X, 56*X
- Polynomial functions
	- Polynomial functions are the product of any number of predictor variables
	- For example, Z*X, X*X, Z*X*Z*X*X
- Exponential functions
	- Exponential functions are the exponential of a predictor variable
	- For example, exp(X)
- Logarithmic functions
	- Logarithmic functions are the logarithm of a predictor variable
	- For example, log(X)
- Cosine functions
	- Cosine functions are the cosine of a predictor variable
	- For example, cos(X)
