## General Description
- ARIMA stands for Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average
- ARIMA models can either be seasonal or non-seasonal models
- ARIMA models are typically used for time-series forecasting
- Specifically, ARIMA models explain a given time series based on its own past values, that is, its own lags and the lagged forecast errors, so that equation can be used to forecast future values


## Auto Regressive Model
- The auto regressive in ARIMA means the model is a linear regression model, where the each predictor refers to a data point from a previous point in time
- For example, if we are predicting today's sales using an auto regressive model, then one predictor could refer to yesterday's sales, another predictor could refer to the sales from two days ago, etc.
