## General Description
- The simplest form of exponential smoothing is given by the formula: st = ⍺xt + (1 - ⍺)s(t-1)
- This simple form of exponential smoothing is also known as an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA)
- Technically it can also be classified as an ARIMA model with no constant term and parameterized as (0,1,1)
