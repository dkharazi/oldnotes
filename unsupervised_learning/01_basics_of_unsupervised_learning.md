## Supervised versus Unsupervised Learning
- Roughly, supervised learning is a modeling process for some response variable that has already been observed
- On the other hand, unsupervised learning is a modeling process for some variable that has not been observed
- In other words, supervised learning refers to examples (or training data) that have already been labeled by someone who knew what they were doing
- And, unsupervised learning refers to discovering examples that have not been observed in the data yet
- Supervised learning allows us to verify the performance on the labeled training data, whereas unsupervised learning does not allow us to do this

## Types of Learning Problems

| Known Classes? | Class Labels                             | Type of Learning Problem            |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Yes            | Given for training data                  | Classification; supervised learning |
| Yes            | Given for some but not all training data | Semi-supervised learning            |
| Yes            | Hints/feedback                           | Feedback or reinforcement learning  |
| No             | None                                     | Clustering; unsupervised learning   |
