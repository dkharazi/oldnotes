## General Description
- PCA is a dimensionality reduction algoritmh
- Pca involves calculating eigenvectors in its process
- The dimensionality reduction algorithm is a linear transformation (of eigenvectors and data...maybe covaraince?)
- The algorithm used to calculate eigenvectors is a non-linear transformation (of ...)
